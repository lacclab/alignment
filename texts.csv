Before Greece was plunged into financial chaos, residents of this tranquil outpost in the northern Aegean managed quite well. They did their banking at the post office and the few dozen rooms to rent were booked out every summer with people who had heard – by word of mouth – of its spectacular empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood."
1,1_10_1,Ele,"The Greek island of Agios Efstratios is very remote. It has been forgotten by the banks, the government and most of the modern world. It doesn't have a single ATM or credit-card machine. Before the economic crisis in Greece, the people of this peaceful island in the northern Aegean lived quite well. The few rooms to rent were fully booked every summer with people enjoying its empty beaches, clear seas and fresh seafood."
2,1_10_2,Adv,"But, because the island still runs on cash, the closure of banks nationwide has been devastating. Residents have been forced to make nine-hour round trips to the nearest big island to get cash and Greek visitors say they can't get together enough cash to come. “Tourist numbers are down 80% this year,” said Mayor Maria Kakali, in an office in the village where she grew up, home to around 200 people. “Even people born here and living in Athens, who have their own places on the island, aren't coming.”"

4,1_10_3,Adv,"Kakali has badgered the government and a major Greek bank into promising an ATM within weeks but she still feels it may come too late for this season on an island where tourism dwarfs the two other sources of income: fishing and agriculture: “We have almost no reservations in August, when usually we have people calling us up asking to find a room and we can't help them.” A hard winter ahead may be slightly improved by 50 workers billeted in the village to expand the harbor but there is an even bigger crisis looming because the government has said it will end a decades-old tax break for islands."

6,1_10_4,Adv,"Created to help island communities survive when they were suffering mass emigration, a lower sales tax contained the costs of living in places where everything had to be imported and made tourism more affordable. Tourist favorites such as Mykonos fear that losing the tax breaks will make it hard for them to compete with Turkey but, for Agios Efstratios, it poses a far greater threat. “If we have to pay a tax of 23%, I'm sorry to say it but we will all die on the island,” says Kakali. Food and fuel are already more expensive than on mainland Greece, there are no economies of scale and little economic flexibility on an island which, even in summer, has only three shops, two restaurants and not a single official hotel. “This is an expensive island. Everything, even milk or bread, has changed hands three or four times before it gets to us and each middleman has to take a profit,” said Provatas Costas, a 58-year-old fisherman."

8,1_10_5,Adv,"For Agios Efstratios and its closest large neighbor, Lemnos, the timing of the crisis is particularly cruel. They were condemned to relative obscurity for years in part because they are served by slow and unreliable ferries. In 2015, the government had finally given the contract to a new, efficient company, drawing floods of new visitors to explore the islands' largely overlooked charms, before the bank controls hit. “This season started out as the best season in 30 years and, in one week, became the worst,” said Atzamis Konstantinos, a travel agent in Lemnos who used to earn €15,000 a month as a captain of petroleum tankers and other large ships but came home because he missed it so much."

Lemnos is the eighth largest island in Greece so it is in line for the first round of tax increases in autumn 2015 but far less wealthy than many smaller ones. It has just over 3,000 beds for visitors, compared with tens of thousands on an island such as Rhodes. Its councilors say that they will fight the tax rise, although none can say how. “We have been suffering economically in recent years and, now, we will suffer more,” said Lemnos Mayor, Dimitris Marinakis. “When there is not enough money, you reduce your consumption and therefore the whole economy declines.”"

Because it is one of the smallest islands, Agios Efstratios has until 2017 before the rise is due to come in, so Kakali hopes that the roller coaster of Greek politics means it yet may be spared. If not, though, she plans to travel to Athens to remind the distant government what the tax rise would cost. “The truth is the government doesn't pay much attention to the islands of the north Aegean,” she said, “so I would take all the kids from our school to the gates of parliament, to tell them: ‘There is still life in these islands'.”"

28,1_2_1,Adv,"A nasal spray laced with the ‘Love hormone' oxytocin could help children with autism learn to handle social situations better, US researchers claim. Scans of children with autistic spectrum disorder showed that a single dose of the chemical improved brain responses to facial expressions, a shift that could make social interactions feel more natural and rewarding for them. The scientists behind the research said a course of oxytocin might boost the success of behavioral therapies that are already used to help people with autism learn to cope with social situations. “Over time, what you would expect to see is more appropriate social responding, being more interested in interacting with other people, more eye contact and more conversational ability,” said Kevin Pelphrey, director of the Child Neuroscience Lab at Yale University."

The scans were given 45 minutes after the participants inhaled a placebo or oxytocin through a nasal spray. The scans showed that reward circuitry in the children's brains behaved more normally after a snort of oxytocin, being more active when the person was looking at faces and less active when viewing the inanimate cars.

There is no telling what they are buying. We are nowhere near thinking this is a ready treatment.

If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighborhood, it can deliver from that base. You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.” It's one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. “The larger the distance the drone travels, the more dangerous it becomes.” Of course, safety remains a major concern – Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours. Drones, he said, are “one or two orders of magnitude away” from that benchmark. “The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,” Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, doesn't count as catastrophic failure – something has to fall out of the sky."

A good proportion of these offenders go on to populate adult jails.

The UK's submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, told the UN that it “acknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia,” but it adds: “The United Kingdom is … concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and – most importantly – the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the illegal drugs trade and could weaken the international community's response to that trade.”"

The first thing he did when the experiment ended was invite his friends around for the evening to enjoy “a plate of cheese and listen to the David Bowie album Aladdin Sane.” “It was difficult not being able to invite people around because there was nowhere to sit ... but I'd choose Bowie over a sofa any day.”"

304,3_8_1,Adv,"Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by an enormous explosion that blew in the balcony windows and shattered clay pots containing her few houseplants. When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapor trail hanging in the morning sky and hear the wail of car alarms from the street below. “I didn't understand what was going on,” said Zaglumyonova. “There was a big explosion and then a series of little explosions. My first thought was that it was a plane crash.” What she had actually witnessed were the death throes of a ten-ton meteorite that plunged to Earth in a series of fireballs just after sunrise. Officials put the number of people injured at almost 1,200, with more than 40 taken to hospital – most as a result of flying glass shattered by the sonic boom created by the meteorite's descent. There were no reported deaths."

306,3_8_2,Adv,"The meteorite entered the atmosphere traveling at a speed of at least 33,000mph and broke up into chunks between 18 and 32 miles above the ground, according to a statement from the Russian Academy of Sciences. The event caused panic in Chelyabinsk, a Russian city of one million people to the south of the Ural mountains, as mobile phone networks swiftly became jammed by the volume of calls. Amateur video footage from the area, often peppered with the obscene language of frightened observers, showed the chunks of meteorite glowing more brightly as they approached the moment of impact. The vapor trail was visible for hundreds of miles around, including in neighboring Kazakhstan."

A steady stream of lightly injured people, most suffering cuts from flying glass, came into the clinic where Bets works. She said a nearby college was particularly badly affected and many of the students were brought in suffering from fright. “There were a lot of girls from the college in shock. Some were very pale and many of them fainted,” she said. Early estimates suggested more than 100,000 square meters of glass had been broken and 3,000 buildings hit.

Some were quick to take advantage of the confusion. Enterprising people were offering lumps of meteorite for sale through internet sites within a few hours of the impact.

319,3_9_2,Adv,"For 14 years, SOHAY, a grassroots non-governmental organization (NGO) funded by the Global Fund for Children and Comic Relief, has been working in slum areas of Dhaka to get child laborers into school. It focuses on children working in hazardous conditions – in aluminum and plastic factories, and tanneries. The classroom is one of 23 urban development centers that SOHAY has set up across the capital. The centers prepare children for primary school with classes that help them catch up on their education. Once they are in primary school, the children can do homework at the centers, with help from their peers. Alamin, ten, who used to work in a plastic factory, attends one of the centers. His father is a street seller and his mother a part-time domestic worker. They are all happy that he's now in school and away from hazardous work. His friend Rabi says he wants to forget his past in the factory. “I like school,” he says."

After they leave work, they sometimes find it difficult to make friends and adapt to school.” It is also very challenging to ensure they stay in school – the dropout rate is very high for these children. Seven-year-old Zhorna Akter Sumayya has two older brothers, both of whom are in work (one at a restaurant, one at a local club).

The organization is also helping 635 children who are working in hazardous conditions to know their rights under Bangladesh's 2010 child labor elimination code of conduct. The policy aimed to eradicate all forms of child labor by 2015 but that target was missed. The Labor Law of Bangladesh 2006 bans children under the age of 14 from working but, according to the UN children's agency, UNICEF, 4.7 million children under that age are employed in the informal sector and 1.3 million aged five to 17 work in hazardous industries."
