In February 2013, with the possibility of up to eight years in prison, he decided to run away. His actions in 2006 to 2008 made many people notice the anti-capitalist movement for the first time. This happened at a time when many Spanish people were looking for alternatives to a system that has caused problems in their lives.\n",

      "<<text>>While the same actions would probably be better understood in today's Spain, he said that they would not be needed. The anti-capitalist movement has grown from a fringe movement to one supported by thousands of Spaniards, he said, evidenced by the widely supported movements such as the Indignados. Duran is widening his focus to include Spain's justice system, by promoting restorative justice. “The people in Spain who believe that banks don't work, they think that I don't owe anything. I also think that,” he said. “But there is a part of a population that is not in agreement with us and I think I should respond to that.” In his case, he said, the element of reciprocity he could offer to banks might lie in the insight he gleaned from years of obtaining bank loans fraudulently. He could share his thoughts on “which best practices work and the bad ones that don't, for the general population and for bank workers”.\n",

      "<<text>>How far away are we from a world where drones deliver packages? If Amazon is to be believed, not far at all. Others are not so sure: technical progress past this point isn't merely a matter of invention; it's a matter of public safety. Paul Misener, Amazon's vice-president of global public policy, told a congressional hearing recently that his company would be ready as soon as all the rules were in place. The Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) will finally have regulations governing the commercial use of unmanned aircraft by June 2016. But the technology has a long way to go before then and larger machines aren't airway-legal at all yet – only drones up to 25kg will be covered and the FAA points out in the proposed rules that, if you're going to crowd the skies with radio-controlled flying robots, they had better all be using different radio frequencies that nobody can jam or hijack.\n",

      "<<text>>Professor Sanjiv Singh, who runs a cargo delivery company called NearEarth, said that piloting a state-of-the-art drone was a little more like leaving it a trail of breadcrumbs: go to this altitude, perform this short task, go back home. But even short flights from a mobile landing pad pose serious logistical problems, he said. “They're not proposing to deliver from one uninhabited place to another uninhabited place; they're proposing to deliver from a warehouse to where the consumer is, which is likely an urban area,” he said. “There are going to be hazards along the way that the vehicle is going to have to detect. Maybe there will be terrain that the map doesn't know about. Even then, maybe there's construction equipment that wasn't there but is there now. Maybe GPS signals are blocked, in which case it's going to have an incorrect idea about where it is.” All this is surmountable, he said – but it's difficult.\n",

      "<<text>>One major problem is maintaining radio contact with a drone and planning for what happens if that contact breaks. “If you have an off-the-shelf UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle), it'll just keep going and crash into the ground,” said roboticist Daniel Huber. “Technologically, most of the things that are needed for this are in place,” said Huber. He is working on a program that proposes using drones to inspect infrastructure – pipelines, telephone lines, bridges and so on. “We've developed an exploration algorithm where you draw a box around an area and it'll autonomously fly around that area and look at every surface and then report back.”\n",

      "<<text>>Huber said about Amazon: “I have heard them say that many packages are lightweight – a drone can carry a kilogram for 15 minutes. If you have a vehicle that can go into a neighborhood, it can deliver from that base. You need a 15-minute distance and typical off-the-shelf drones have about that distance.” It's one way, he said, of making sure the surrounding population is relatively safe. “The larger the distance the drone travels, the more dangerous it becomes.” Of course, safety remains a major concern – Singh points out that, for a commercial aircraft to be considered skyworthy, it has to prove a rate of one serious failure every one million hours. Drones, he said, are “one or two orders of magnitude away” from that benchmark. “The Reaper drone has one failure in 10,000 hours,” Singh said. An oil leak, by the way, doesn't count as catastrophic failure – something has to fall out of the sky.\n",

I shudder to think that one of these things might come down on a crowded highway.” Part of the solution, Singh said, is comprehensive contingency planning: “If things fail, the vehicle has to do something reasonable.”\n",
